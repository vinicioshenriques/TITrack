**Track your loot. Know your profit. Farm smarter.**

TITrack is a free, privacy-focused desktop app for Windows and Linux that reads Torchlight Infinite game logs to automatically track every item you pick up, calculate profit per map run, and show your net worth in real time. No cheating, no memory hooks, no cloud account required — just pure log parsing.

Whether you're min-maxing your farming route or just curious how much you're earning per hour, TITrack gives you the data to make better decisions.

### Highlights

- **Fully automatic** — picks up loot events from game logs as you play
- **Profit per map** — see exactly how much each run earns you
- **Net worth tracking** — real-time inventory valuation in Flame Elementium (FE)
- **Always-on-top overlay** — compact transparent overlay for single-monitor setups
- **Price learning** — searches the in-game Exchange to learn item prices automatically
- **Community pricing** — opt-in anonymous cloud sync for crowd-sourced prices
- **100% local** — all data stored on your machine, no account needed
- **Portable** — no installation, just extract and run

Inspired by [WealthyExile](https://github.com/WealthyExile) for Path of Exile.

## Quick Start

**No installation required** — TITrack is a portable app. Download, extract, and run.

### Recommended: Use the Setup Tool

Windows users should use the setup tool:

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/astockman99/TITrack/releases/latest)
2. Download **`TITrack-Setup.exe`**
3. Run it and choose where to extract (e.g. `C:\TITrack`)
4. Click **Extract**, then **Open Folder**
5. Run **`TITrack.exe`**

> The Setup tool downloads and extracts TITrack programmatically, which avoids the Windows "Mark of the Web" security restrictions that can cause issues with manual ZIP downloads.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Manual ZIP</strong></summary>

1. Download `TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/astockman99/TITrack/releases/latest)
2. Extract to any folder
3. **Important:** Unblock the files after extracting (see [Windows Security Notes](#windows-security-notes) below)
4. Run `TITrack.exe`

</details>

### Linux: Manual ZIP

1. Download `TITrack-x.x.x-linux.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/astockman99/TITrack/releases/latest)
2. Extract it to a folder such as `~/Games/TITrack`
3. Run `./TITrack`

On Arch/CachyOS, install the native window dependencies if the packaged build does not already include everything your desktop needs:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed gtk3 webkit2gtk
```

### First-Time Setup

Once TITrack is running:

1. **Game location** — TITrack auto-detects Steam and standalone installations. If your game is in a non-standard location, it will prompt you to browse for it.
2. **Enable logging** — In-game, open Settings > **Other** tab > click **Enable Log**. TITrack reads these log files to track your loot.
3. **Character detection** — If you've played recently with logging enabled, your character is detected from the existing log. If not detected, switch characters or relog without closing the game — TITrack will pick it up from the new log lines.
3. **Sync your inventory** — Open your bag in-game and click the **Sort** button. This triggers a full inventory snapshot so TITrack knows your current items.
4. **Learn prices** — Search any item on the in-game Exchange. TITrack captures the price automatically and starts valuing that item in all calculations. Or, enable **Cloud Sync** in the dashboard header to download community-sourced prices instantly.

## In-Game Overlay

TITrack includes a compact always-on-top overlay window so you can see your stats without alt-tabbing.

![Overlay in-game](docs/screenshots/overlay.png)

- **Launch**: Click "Overlay" in the dashboard, or run `TITrack.exe --overlay` on Windows / `./TITrack --overlay` on Linux
- **Transparent background** with text drop shadows for visibility over any game scene
- **Click-through** — stats and loot areas pass clicks to the game underneath on Windows; Linux uses a frameless always-on-top web overlay
- **Live stats**: Net Worth, FE/Hour, FE/Map, Runs, Avg Time, Total Time
- **Current run tracking**: Zone name, duration, and top loot drops sorted by value
- **Previous run preservation**: When a map ends, loot stays visible labeled "Previous Run"
- **Adjustable font size** (A-/A+ buttons, 70%–160%, setting is saved)
- **Pin/unpin** always-on-top, draggable header, resizable corners
- **Compact mode**: Hide loot pickups in Settings for stats-only view

---

## Loot Report

The Report button opens a full breakdown of all loot collected across your runs.

![Loot report](docs/screenshots/loot-report.png)

- **Summary stats**: Gross value, map costs, profit, runs, total time, profit/hour, profit/map
- **Doughnut chart** showing top 10 items by value with percentages
- **Full item table**: Icon, name, quantity, unit price, total value, % of total
- **CSV export**: Save the full report to a file for external analysis

<summary><strong>Windows Security Notes</strong></summary>

Since TITrack is not code-signed, Windows may show security warnings.

### SmartScreen Warning

Click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"**. This is normal for unsigned applications.

### Mark of the Web (MOTW)

Windows marks files downloaded from the internet as untrusted, which can prevent some DLLs from loading. **Using TITrack-Setup.exe avoids this entirely.**

If you downloaded the ZIP manually, unblock the files after extracting:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\TITrack" -Recurse | Unblock-File
```

Or right-click the folder > Properties > check "Unblock" (if available).

> **Note:** Unblocking just the ZIP before extracting is not sufficient — Windows' built-in extractor still marks extracted files. You must unblock after extracting.

If the native window still won't open, the app falls back to browser mode. Check `data\titrack.log` for details.

<summary><strong>Development Setup</strong></summary>

> This section is for developers. Regular users should follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) above.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Windows 10/11 / Linux
- .NET 8 SDK (Windows WPF overlay only)
- Arch/CachyOS native window dependencies: `gtk3` and `webkit2gtk`
- Torchlight Infinite

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astockman99/TITrack.git
cd TITrack

# If Arch-based Linux, create a .venv to install dependencies into:
python -m venv ./.venv

# Activate it (if you're using a Terminal like fish, ensure you use the corresponding activate file):
./.venv/bin/activate

pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m titrack init --seed tlidb_items_seed_en.json
```

### Running in Development

```bash
python -m titrack serve                # Native window (default)
python -m titrack serve --no-window    # Browser mode for debugging
python -m titrack serve --port 8080    # Custom port
```

### Building

```bash
# Windows: build WPF overlay (requires .NET 8 SDK)
dotnet publish overlay/TITrackOverlay.csproj -c Release -o overlay/publish

# Build main application on the current OS
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller ti_tracker.spec --noconfirm

# Windows only: copy overlay to dist if needed
cp overlay/publish/TITrackOverlay.exe dist/TITrack/
```

Output is in `dist/TITrack/`.

### Starting the app on Arch-based Linux
```bash
# TITrack sets this automatically, but you can also pass it explicitly:
env WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 ./TITrack
```

### Tests

```bash
pytest tests/              # Run all tests (~137 tests, ~3 seconds)
pytest tests/ -v           # Verbose output
pytest tests/ --cov=titrack --cov-report=html   # With coverage
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **FE** (Flame Elementium) | Primary currency, ConfigBaseId `100300` |
| **ConfigBaseId** | Integer item type identifier from game logs |
| **Delta** | Change in quantity (current - previous) for a slot |
| **Run Value** | FE gained + sum(item qty x item price) for priced items |
| **Reference Price** | 10th percentile of exchange listings |
| **Slot State** | Current inventory tracked per (PageId, SlotId) |

<summary><strong>Design Principles</strong></summary>

1. **Privacy first** — all data stored locally by default, no accounts
2. **No cheating** — only reads log files, no memory hooks or injection
3. **Passive price learning** — prices learned from your own exchange searches
4. **Pure domain logic** — core has no I/O dependencies, easy to test
5. **Incremental processing** — resumes from last position, handles log rotation
6. **Opt-in cloud** — cloud sync is optional, anonymous, and transparent
